= A Build System for LaTeX

This repo contains a set of Perl scripts for building LaTeX documents.

The scripts are designed to be used with https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk[latexmk].

They are used to build documents and packages in the 
https://github.com/src2crs[Source2Course] GitHub organization,
as well as in my repos for programming courses.
