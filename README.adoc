= A Build System for LaTeX

This repo contains a set of Perl scripts for building LaTeX documents.

The scripts are designed to be used with https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk[latexmk].

They are used to build documents and packages in the 
https://github.com/src2crs[Source2Course] GitHub organization,
as well as in my repos for programming courses.

== Usage

To use this build system, copy the files
link:latexmkrc and link:buildscripts.pl into your project.
then, adjust the settings in the latexmkrc file and run latexmk.

You may also want to add any directories named `build` to the .gitignore file
(or whatever you have changed the output directory to).

The other files in this repo are for testing purposes and serve as examples,
but they are not needed for building documents.
